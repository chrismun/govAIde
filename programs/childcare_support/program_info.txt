To be financially eligible for child care assistance, a family's gross monthly income must be at or below 185% of the FPL for the family size.

If a family's gross monthly income has increased to between 185% and 200% of the FPL at their yearly redetermination, then the family will receive a graduated phase-out of child care assistance for a twelve-month period before the child care case is closed.

Any time that a family's gross monthly income exceeds 85% of the SMI or the family no longer has a need for child care assistance, the child care case will close.

 You may choose your child care provider from:

DELAWARE COST OF QUALITY CHILD CARE ESTIMATOR TOOL
As required by HB 250 Section 183. The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) and the Department of Education (DOE), in consultation with the Delaware Early Childhood Council (DECC), has created a cost of quality child care estimator tool, which enables the state to model the actual costs of providing quality child care. Delaware engaged Prenatal to Five Fiscal Strategies (P5FS) to support the development of the cost of quality child care estimator tool customized for the state of Delaware. The work on the cost estimator tool was informed by Delaware's 2021 Cost of Care Study, the 2021 Market Rate Survey, the child care wage scale work completed in 2022, national and local experts, advocates, and early childhood educators. P5FS is led by national early childhood finance experts Jeanna Capito and Simon Workman, P5FS has developed cost estimation models for several states and communities. Their models have informed child care subsidy rate setting and other early childhood policies and are aligned with cost model guidance provided by the U.S. Office of Child Care for alternative rate setting under the Child Care Development Block Grant. We are excited to share the cost of care estimator tools, you will find links to Delaware's Center and Family Child Care Cost Estimation Tools below. We are also pleased to share the Cost Estimation Model Report for the project below.
