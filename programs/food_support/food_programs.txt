Delaware SNAP Emergency Food Benefits
Food Supplement Program
A federal law was passed that stopped Emergency Food Benefits. Households got their final Emergency Food Benefits on their EBT cards on February 28, 2023.

Food Supplement Program

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a food supplemental program that enables low-income families to buy a variety of food that is the basis for better nutrition. Benefits are issued electronically to the family's Delaware Food First card each month. This is an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card. The Food Supplement Program recipient uses this card at local grocery stores to access his/her food benefit.

The United States Department of Agriculture, Food & Nutrition Service (FNS), is the federal agency responsible for overseeing the Food Supplement Program. Please see our Related Links page for the FNS website.

Eligibility

Eligibility for Delaware's Food Supplement Program is based on factors such as who lives and eats together, relationship in the home and household income. All children who are 21 years of age and younger and live with their parents must apply for food benefits with their parents. Applications for the Food Supplement Program must be U.S. Citizens or eligible aliens to qualify. Individuals who receive TANF, GA or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) do not need to meet an income test to receive food benefits. The maximum gross monthly income limit for most households is set at 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Currently, there is no resource test for most households that meet the 200% FPL maximum gross monthly income limit.
